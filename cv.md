## Code Example

**Task:** *The array of integers is given. It is necessary to shift the zero elements to the end of the array, while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.*

```php
function ShiftZeroValues($arr)
{
    $index = 0;
    $nullCount = 0;
    
    while ($index < count($arr) - $nullCount) {
        if ($arr[$index] === 0) {
            array_splice($arr, $index, 1);
            $arr[] = 0;
            $nullCount++;
        } else {
            $index++;
        }
    }
    
    return $arr;
}

function test($arr)
{
    printf("[%s] => [%s]\n", implode(', ', $arr),  implode(', ', ShiftZeroValues($arr)));
}

test([0, 1, -8, 2, 0, 5, 0]); // [1, -8, 2, 5, 0, 0, 0]
test([4, 0, 6, 0, 0, -5]);    // [4, 6, -5, 0, 0, 0]
test([2, 5, 9, 1, -7]);       // [2, 5, 9, 1, -7]
